This library depends on having the base libsquid library installed
as well as cfitsio (>3.27) and wcslib (>4.19).  After compiling you
can check if your wcslib is new enough by running ./test_xphwcs and
looking for errors.  If this does not work, the HSC projection wcs
functions will not work in the polar regions.  The other projections
should work properly.

Currently the build system in use is cmake.  The best way to
build the system is to make a build directory in the location
of your choice, cd to it, and then run:
> cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/path] /path/to/libsquid_wcs
> make
At this point the library is compiled locally to your build directory.
There are several utility programs located in the bin/ subdir of your
build directory.  Most of these programs will give a short usage message
if run without arguments.  See the documentation for more details.

To perform a system installation at this point, simply do the following.
> sudo make install
The default install path is to /usr/local.

To build rpms, debs, and tgz files, simply do the following in your
build directory:
> make package
> make package_source
The resulting output files will be in the packages/ subdir of your
build directory.

As an alternate to cmake, there is a generic Makefile included which
might work for you.
